CNN that predicts the type of the pokemon. I made 2 versions of this exercisee. Inside the notebooks you can read more about them.

Predict one type -> [pokemon_primary_type_predicter.ipynb](https://github.com/School-Semester-Summaries/AI-semester-6/blob/main/repos/CNN%20Exercise%202%20(Pokemon)/pokemon_primary_type_predicter.ipynb)

Predict two types -> [pokemon_secondary_type_predicter.ipynb](https://github.com/School-Semester-Summaries/AI-semester-6/blob/main/repos/CNN%20Exercise%202%20(Pokemon)/pokemon_secondary_type_predicter.ipynb)
