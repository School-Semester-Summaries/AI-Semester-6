# Open Programme
Original goal was to learn how to create a RL Agent that can learn how to play Brawlhalla by only screenshots as input. This was too hard so i simplified the problem to trying to learn how to create an RL Agent that can improve by just seeing the screen in CartPole game.

In the end I did manage to create an application that can beat a medium bot in Brawlhalla with AI, but without RL -> [Beating Medium Bot in Brawlhalla with Python](https://youtu.be/4esckiZkZu8?feature=shared)
